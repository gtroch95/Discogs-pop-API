## Introduction

In the current era of streaming services, music released on physical formats like vinyls, CDs, and cassettes feels antithetical to the way most people interact with music today. However, for smaller artists, the ability to make a living through music translates to touring, merch sales, and album sales, not streams. Issues of abysmal artist compensation by major streaming services as well the ephemerality of streamed media and lack of personal ownership makes physical media a potentially appealing alternative for music fans. Through this project, I aimed to visualize changes in record collecting over the past 10 years and provide a picture of what it looks like in its current state using release data and community collecting data from the Discogs API.  

Specifically, the Discogs API was used to fetch vinyl, CD, and cassette release data from major labels, independent labels, and unsigned artists from 2015-2025, alongside "want" and "have" data from Discogs community members pertaining to releases. Pop music was chosen for this project because it moves with the trends, making it a good candidate for visualization. Through visualizing the data, I hoped to showcase pop music collecting as a microcosm of physical music releases and record collecting in general. 

## Visualizations and Takeaways

With this graph showing the past 10 years of physical pop music releases, we see that releases of pop music on vinyl, CD, and cassette have decreased, with a noticeable drop in 2025.

26,859 of releases from 2015-2025 were re-releases of older music. In 2025 specifically, 1,753 of the total releases were re-releases of older music. Therefore, the majority of music being released on physical formats is new. Additionally, for re-releases from 2025, there were 54,721 "wants" total from the Discogs community, and 248,037 "haves."

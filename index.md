## Introduction

In the current era of streaming services, music released on physical formats like vinyls, CDs, and cassettes feels antithetical to the way most people interact with music today. However, for smaller artists, the ability to make a living through music translates to touring, merch sales, and album sales, not streams. The issues of abysmal artist compensation by major streaming services as well the ephemerality of streamed media and lack of personal ownership makes physical media a potentially appealing alternative for music fans, and was something I wanted to explore through this project. 

Over the course of this project, the Discogs API was used to fetch vinyl, CD, and cassette release data from major labels, independent labels, and unsigned artists from 2015-2025. Pop music was chosen because it moves with the trends, making it a good candidate for visualization. Through visualizing the data, I hoped to understand how physical pop record releases have developed over the past decade and where pop record collecting actually stands in 2025.

26,859 of releases from 2015-2025 were re-releases of older music. In 2025 specifically, 1,753 of the total releases were re-releases of older music. Therefore, the majority of music being released on physical formats is new. Additionally, for re-releases from 2025, there were 54,721 "wants" total from the Discogs community, and 248,037 "haves."

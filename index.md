In the current era of streaming services, music released on physical formats like vinyls, CDs, and cassettes feels antithetical to the way most people interact with music today. However, for smaller artists, the ability to make a living through music translates to touring, merch sales, and album sales, not streams. The issues of abysmal artist compensation by major streaming services as well the ephemerality of streamed media and lack of personal ownership makes physical media a potentially appealing alternative for music fans, and was something I wanted to explore through this project. 

Over the course of this project, the Discogs API was used to fetch vinyl, CD, and cassette release data from major labels, independent labels, and unsigned artists from 2015-2025. Pop music was chosen because it moves with the trends, making it a good candidate for visualization. Through visualizing the data, I hoped to understand how physical pop record releases have developed over the past decade and where pop record collecting actually stands in 2025.
